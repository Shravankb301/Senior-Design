          <h4 class="text-center mb-5">Semester 1<h4>

            <h6><u>Researching on various AI tools: </u></h6>
            <p class="mb-5">Our research journey began by exploring various autocomplete AI tools such as GitHub Copilot and Open AI. We delved into the existing research papers and gained insights into how these tools can assist programmers in various ways. However, we also discovered that these tools come with their own set of disadvantages. This realization sparked our interest in a broader question: Will these AI tools replace programmers in the future?</p>
            
            <h6><u>Narrow down to certain tools out of all of them to understand itâ€™s capacity better</u></h6>
            <p class="mb-5">During our research, we came across several AI autocomplete tools, but two of them particularly caught our attention: GitHub Copilot and Open AI. These tools piqued our interest due to their popularity and potential impact on the programming community. As we delved deeper into the literature, we realized that understanding these tools and their capabilities would be crucial for completing our project successfully. Therefore, we decided to focus our investigation on these specific tools in order to thoroughly assess their effectiveness and implications for daily programming tasks.</p>
            
            <h6><u>Deciding our audience pool and categories them </u></h6>
            <p class="mb-5">After conducting thorough research on the selected tools, we proceeded to conduct our own testing to gain insights into the impact of these tools on the daily life of a programmer. To ensure a representative sample, we identified our target audience as computer science students who were enrolled in the programming for the web (PFW) course and possessed basic coding knowledge. To capture the diverse range of skills and experience levels, we categorized the participants into four sections: freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. This approach allowed us to gather data from a varied group of students at different stages of their academic journey, providing a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of the AI/ML autocomplete coding tools in different educational contexts.</p>
            
            <h6><u>Questions for the pretest</u></h6>
            <p>Once we had identified our target audience, which consisted of computer science students at different levels of education (freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior), we developed specific questions for each category. These questions were designed to assess the participants' knowledge and expertise in programming, with the aim of understanding how the use of AI autocomplete tools would impact their ability to answer them.</p>
            <p>Each category of participants was given three different questions, and they were instructed to answer them without using any AI tools, which would take approximately 5-10 minutes. We then compared the results of their responses with and without the use of the AI tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool in enhancing their ability to answer the questions.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">This approach allowed us to assess the effectiveness of the AI autocomplete tool in improving the participants' performance in answering the questions, and to determine whether the tool had a significant impact on their ability to complete the tasks. By comparing the results with and without the AI tool, we aimed to gain insights into the potential benefits and limitations of using such tools in daily programming tasks for different levels of expertise.</p>
            
            <h6><u>Pretest runs</u></h6>
            <p>To ensure the smooth execution of our research, we conducted a pretest with a small group of approximately 10-15 students from our target audience pool. The purpose of the pretest was to familiarize ourselves with the research procedures and to assess the time it would take for participants to complete the tasks </p>

        <h6><u>More research on ChatGPT & Changing qurstions for bigger testing</u></h6>
        
        <p class="mb-5"> Towards the end of our Senior Capstone project's first semester, ChatGPT-3 was released in November 2022. We delved deeper into ChatGPT-3's capabilities this semester through our research. After examining our initial findings and analyzing the capabilities of ChatGPT-3, we decided to update our testing methodology to assess the effectiveness of ChatGPT-3 in answering questions in different formats. To achieve this goal, we incorporated two distinct question formats: text and picture. The text-based questions aimed to assess the effectiveness of ChatGPT-3's autocomplete feature in answering open-ended questions accurately by comparing its performance to participants' personal knowledge and unrestricted access to the web. The picture-based questions, on the other hand, focused on evaluating ChatGPT-3's effectiveness in processing visual information and generating accurate responses based on visual cues. By structuring our testing in this way, we were able to assess ChatGPT-3's performance in diverse scenarios and evaluate its potential in various applications, such as natural language processing.</p>
        <h6><u>Testing with large amount of audience </u></h6>
        <p class="mb-5">To find participants for our project, we approached professors of relevant courses and requested permission to conduct testing during their classes. With the professors' approval, we introduced the project to the students and explained the testing procedures. Those who were interested in participating were given further information and asked to sign up for the testing session. By collaborating with professors and conducting testing during class time, we were able to access a diverse pool of participants with varying degrees of knowledge and experience. During the study, participants were presented with two questions we finalized for testing. The text-based question required the participants to provide an answer based on their personal knowledge while having unrestricted access to the web. In contrast, the picture-based question required that the participants answer based solely on the visual information provided in the picture. This approach aimed to examine the effectiveness of using ChatGPT-3's autocomplete feature compared to personal knowledge and visual perception in answering questions accurately. By including two different formats, we aimed to explore the potential of ChatGPT-3 in improving accuracy and efficiency in text-based questions and its effectiveness in processing visual information. This allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT-3 in diverse scenarios and gather more accurate data and insights into the effectiveness of ChatGPT-3 in different scenarios.</p>
        
        <h6><u>Web development</u></h6>
        <p>During testing, our team had the idea to create a website that would serve as a comprehensive repository for all project-related information. To ensure user-friendliness and easy navigation, we utilized modern web development tools and technologies such as VS Code, GitHub, and Versel. The website contains all essential project details, including project objectives, research findings, testing procedures, and comprehensive data analysis. Through the creation of this website, we have created a collaborative platform that facilitates communication and teamwork, enabling us to work together effectively towards the successful completion of our project.</p>
