            <p>GitHub Copilot, developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI, is an AI-powered code generation tool that uses machine learning algorithms to suggest code snippets and complete lines of code based on context and coding patterns [5]. It has garnered significant attention due to its potential to automate coding tasks and enhance developer productivity. Open AI, on the other hand, is a leading AI research organization known for its cutting-edge advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Their GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, including GPT-3, have been widely used in various applications, including code generation and auto-completion [9].  </p>
            <p>The outcomes of our research demonstrate that AI tools offer programmers numerous benefits, such as heightened productivity, reduced coding errors, and timesaving. The autocomplete feature of AI tools provides suggestions to programmers that help improve their coding efficiency and save time. Furthermore, AI tools like GitHub Copilot are capable of automating programming tasks to a considerable degree by generating complete code snippets based on natural language inputs [8]. </p>
            <p>However, it should be noted that these AI tools have certain limitations. For instance, they may not be capable of comprehending the context of the code, which could result in errors or inappropriate code suggestions. Moreover, these tools may be unable to handle complex coding tasks requiring advanced problem-solving skills and creativity. Additionally, specific AI tools may require significant computational resources, which could be cost-prohibitive for some organizations.  </p>
            <p class="mb-5">Subsequently, to conduct a focused and comprehensive investigation, we have decided to narrow our research focus to two prominent AI tools in the programming community, namely GitHub Copilot and Open AI. These tools have gained widespread popularity and are known for their advanced code generation and autocompletion capabilities. We believe that a thorough assessment of the capabilities and implications of these tools would be critical to completing our research project. </p>
            
            <h6><u>Deciding our audience pool and categories them </u></h6>
            <p>As part of our research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) autocomplete coding tools, we conducted a testing phase to gain deeper insights into the impact of these tools on the daily life of programmers. To ensure a representative sample, we specifically targeted computer science students enrolled in PFW for Programming courses and with basic coding knowledge. To capture a diverse range of skills and experience levels, we categorized them into four sections based on their academic year - freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors.</p>
            <p>The methodology for categorizing our audience was carefully designed by our team, taking into consideration the findings and insights gained from most of our testing and research conducted at PFW. The development of this methodology was based on rigorous analysis and evaluation of various factors, including research interests, expertise, and areas of specialization. This approach allowed us to gather data from various students at different stages of their academic journey, providing a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of AI/ML autocomplete coding tools in different educational contexts. </p>
            <p class="mb-5">It is important to note that the categorization approach we have implemented was inspired by the may is not suitable for all future testing and research projects. We acknowledge that the dynamic nature of research and evolving requirements of different projects may require adjustments or modifications to our current methodology. </p>
