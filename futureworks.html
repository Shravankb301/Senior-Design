          <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Future Works<h4>

            <p>Throughout our studies and testing we have uncovered that this technology has the potential to change the way that programmers are seen in the job market. Our tests have shown that programming with these tools not only make things faster but also less frustrating for the experience of the programmer. Similar to how factory workers had to adapt after the implementation of technology on assembly lines, the role of a programmer is expected to evolve and take on a different meaning. </p>
            <p>One of the notable applications of ChatGPT in programming, as mentioned in the article "What Can ChatGPT Do? Analyzing Early Reactions to the Innovative AI Chatbot on Twitter" by Viriya Taecharungroj, is its ability to generate complex code quickly. Users have reported that ChatGPT can generate code almost instantly in response to prompts. Additionally, ChatGPT has been utilized for tasks such as translating code between programming languages and fixing bugs. The article goes on to explain that users have been able to incorporate these autocomplete chatbots for programs like Visual Studio Code. based on the interaction of AI tools with code. it can be hypothesized that they may be used for tasks such as quick bug fixing and generating general code. This could potentially lead to a scenario where human programmers are tasked with verifying or checking the code generated by AI, and focusing on higher-level tasks such as software design, architecture, and problem-solving.  [4] </p>
            <p>Autocomplete tools, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to be valuable in addressing coding bugs, ranging from simple mistakes like misspellings to potential memory leaks. According to Surameery and Shakor's article "Use ChatGPT to Solve Programming Bugs," ChatGPT can provide suggestions and corrections to code based on its understanding of the relationships between code and bugs. Autocomplete tools can also predict the likelihood of bugs in new code by leveraging their understanding of code-bug relationships, utilizing their knowledge representation and pattern recognition capabilities, which are derived from their training data. [3] These bug fixing capabilities are furthermore put on display with our testing, in our testing we have uncovered that when using autocomplete tools like ChatGPT, there is a distinct decrease in both the time it takes to produce code and the amount of errors based on how many attempts the user does with their prompts. With this increase in speed, it can lead to faster productions of code and faster, reliable bug fixing.  </p>
            <p>The potential use of AI tools in education extends beyond simple chat interactions. As highlighted in the article "ChatGPT for good? On opportunities and challenges of large language models for education", these tools have the potential to aid in the development of various skills such as programming, report writing, project management, decision making, and problem-solving. They can also assist learners in writing technical reports, legal documents, medical records, and other similar tasks. The ability of AI Chatbots to generate prompts and questions can make training and onboarding much easier. Furthermore, AI Chatbots can assist in educational research by providing students with information and resources on a particular topic and hinting at unexplored aspects and current research topics. Through conversations with an AI Chatbot, students can understand and analyze the material, leading to better comprehension and retention of information. [2] </p>
            <p>This is all thanks to the way that ChatGPT has interactive prompts, these prompts can be expanded on and you can ask intricate things about the subjects that are provided. For instance, if you were to ask about what are functions, you can further ask about how to use global variables and how to pass variables through functions. This is also incredibly helpful when fixing bugs and educating onboarded programers, as they can ask specific questions that people may know very little about. </p>
            <p>It is difficult to determine whether AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are experiencing artificial hallucinations or providing inaccurate information. This problem has been highlighted by Abid Haleem, Mohd Javaid, and Ravi Pratap Singh in their article titled "An era of ChatGPT as a significant futuristic support tool: A study on features, abilities, and challenges". They argue that AI models are limited to making predictions based on the data they have been provided and utilize raw text without links or citations, which may lead to inaccuracies. [1] From our research we have also found out that confidence is based on how much information there is on the internet about the subject. When the topic or programming language is more well known like python or java, it will more often than not produce code that is properly usable. However with languages like C or Ruby, there is a distinct lack of confidence, and itâ€™s harder to get legitimate code from these languages. </p>
            <p class="mb-5">To improve the accuracy of AI chatbots, it is necessary to provide them with more information on the subject matter. The more information the model has, the more confident the response will be. Additionally, users of these AI models must possess proper knowledge on the subject in order to identify false information and correct it. If the problem persists, it may be recommended to have classes that focus on coding languages and their syntaxes, so that users can identify errors in responses and correct them immediately. [1]  This is a primary reason why programmers are not going to be totally erased by Artificial intelligence chatbots, because while they can produce this information, theres no major way of checking if information is false, so the judgement is put upon the user to fix or remake the code produced.  </p>

      <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Conclusion<h4>

        <p>The emergence of AI tools in the programming industry has brought about significant changes, revolutionizing the way programmers approach their work. As a result, programmers have the capability to leverage advanced machine learning algorithms, such as GPT, to enhance their task performance and efficiency.  </p>
        <p>In the past, programmers had limited access to information. limited meaning the information provided was generic and was not subject to a particular problem or case. Users had to rely on books and specific online resources for task-related assistance. However, with the advent of AI tools, this has changed. Based on our research into AI tools such as GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, we have observed that comprehending pre-existing code bases is now considerably more straightforward and less time-consuming thanks to the support provided by these AI tools. One of the significant advantages of AI tools like GPT is that it simplifies the coding process. By posing the appropriate question to the AI tool, programmers can easily grasp the coding process. This saves time and effort and allows programmers to focus on more critical aspects of their work.  </p>
        <p>Based on our study, we hypothesize that AI tools are unlikely to completely replace human programmers. Our study does suggest that AI tools can provide valuable support, guidance, and automation for programmers, freeing them up to focus on more critical aspects of the job. This can result in more efficient and effective task completion, leading to better results overall.  </p>
        <p>Furthermore, the use of AI tools in programming can help reduce errors and increase accuracy. AI tools like GPT can identify errors in the code, recommend changes, and even suggest alternative approaches to solving problems. This can save time and effort while also ensuring the final product meets the desired quality standards.  </p>
        <p> Another significant advantage of AI tools is that they can assist in the testing and debugging process. By using AI tools to test and debug code, programmers can quickly identify errors and improve the overall quality of their work. This can be particularly beneficial when dealing with large and complex codebases that would take a considerable amount of time to test and debug manually. </p>
        <p class="mb-5">Finally, the integration of AI tools such as GPT in programming has brought about significant change, the way programmers approach their work. AI tools can simplify the coding process, reduce errors, increase accuracy, and assist in testing and debugging. However, while AI tools have several advantages, it is important to remember that they are not a replacement for human beings. Programmers must still possess the knowledge and expertise to effectively utilize these tools. As the industry continues to evolve, it is crucial that programmers remain up to date with the latest developments and continually enhance their skills. Ultimately, the use of AI tools in programming has the potential to enhance efficiency, productivity, and the overall quality of work in the industry</p>
